# Why i made it

Some script kiddie asked me if i can automate logging into stressthem.to and filling out the info. First i thought "no" but i thought it would also be a cool thing to try.

# What it does

Upon running it, it welcomes you and asks you to enter in a IP, it then asks you to enter in a time. (It is defult to port 80 but this can be changed inside of the code). When you enter in the IP and time it opens a new chrome client and does the rest for you and when its done it gives you confromation in a message box.

# Things to change

At line 57 you want to enter your stressthem.to username and at line 59 you want to enter your stressthem.to password.
At like 83 you can change the port if you want.
